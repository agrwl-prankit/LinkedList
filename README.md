# LinkedList

Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package. 
This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part.
Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays.

# Implememtation

## Singly linked list
Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence.
In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "Node". Every "Node" contains two fields, data field, and the next field.

### Methods
* insertAtStart
* insertAtEnd
* insertAtPosition
* deleteFirstElement
* deleteLastElement
* deleteElementAtPosition
* retrieveList
* checkListIsEmpty

## Doubly linked list
A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. 
Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.

### Methods
* insertAtStart
* insertAtEnd
* insertAtPosition
* deleteFirstElement
* deleteLastElement
* deleteElementAtPosition
* retrieveListFromStart
* retrieveListFromEnd
* checkListIsEmpty
